# Lion Quest

## Introduction: Background and Objectives

Tourism is a crucial aspect of Singapore's identity, attracting millions of visitors annually. While the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) effectively showcases the country, there's an opportunity to enhance the visitor experience by introducing an exciting and interactive element.

In 2022, Singapore hosted 6.3 million visitors, an impressive number, but there's room for improvement. This proposal introduces a user-friendly game, "Lion Quest," designed to make touring Singapore more enjoyable by turning it into an exploration game.

The primary goal is to create a fun and engaging game to encourage more tourists to explore Singapore. By gamifying tourism, the aim is not only to enhance visitor satisfaction but also to contribute to the recovery of the tourism economy, which faced challenges due to the impact of COVID-19.


## Game Overview

**Lion Quest** is an interactive adventure that begins at Changi Airport. A captivating cutscene welcomes players to Singapore. After passing through immigration, a friendly guide introduces game controls, prompting exploration. Navigate to the MRT station, where a map reveals destinations. Visit landmarks, interact with tour guides who reward players with collectible badges. Upon earning all badges, receive a notification about the departing flight. Conclude the game by returning to the airport, interacting with the guide for closure. An end screen marks the completion of the Singapore exploration journey.
